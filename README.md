# DTSA 5733
This repo contains my final project (both report and YouTube video) for my Relational Database Design course, part of University of Colorado Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science program. The goal was to create/design a relational database from the very beginning consisting of asking questions, creating an entity relationship model/diagram, relational model, and normalizing the model to 3NF.
